# D3_Challenge

## Background

We are tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help others understand data about health risks facing particular demographics. 

The data set included with the challenge is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from:[https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.

## Your Task

You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty`.

Using the D3 techniques create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in Javascript and pull the data from a CSV file Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
